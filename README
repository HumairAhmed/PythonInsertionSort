Program Description:

Written for educational purposes. Program takes a list of numbers from a file
named 'UNSORTED' and sorts the list while counting each iteration. Displays 
the final sorted list at end and how long it took to sort in seconds. Results 
are also written to a file named 'SORTED'. Program also demonstrates how to use
many file functions from the 'os' library.
